    <h2>We don't talk about Bruno</h2>
    <h3>from "Encanto"</h3>
    <p>We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!<br>
       We don't talk about Bruno... but<br>
       It was my wedding day<br>
       It was our wedding day<br>
       We were getting ready, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky<br>
       No clouds allowed in the sky<br>
       Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-<br>
        Thunder!<br>
        You telling this story, or am I?<br>
        I'm sorry, mi vida, go on<br>
        Bruno says, "It looks like rain"<br>
        Why did he tell us?<br>
        In doing so, he floods my brain<br>
        Abuela, get the umbrellas<br>
        Married in a hurricane<br>
        What a joyous day... but anyway<br>
        We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!<br>
        We don't talk about Bruno!<br>
        Hey! Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling<br>
        I could always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling<br>
        I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch-ch-ch<br>
        It's a heavy lift, with a gift so humbling<br>
        Always left Abuela and the family fumbling<br>
        Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand<br>
        Do you understand?<br>
        A seven-foot frame<br>
        Rats along his back<br>
        When he calls your name<br>
        It all fades to black<br>
        Yeah, he sees your dreams<br>
        And feasts on your screams (hey!)<br>
        We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!<br>
        (We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!)<br>
        We don't talk about Bruno (we don't talk about Bruno!)<br>
        He told me my fish would die<br>
        The next day: dead! (No, no!)<br>
        He told me I'd grow a gut!<br>
        And just like he said... (no, no!)<br>
        He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (no, no! Hey!)<br>
        Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read!<br>
        He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised, and someday be mine<br>
        He told me that my power would grow, like the grapes that thrive on the vine<br>
        Óye, Mariano's on his way<br>
        He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach<br>
        Betrothed to another<br>
        It's like I hear him now<br>
        Hey sis', I want not a sound out of you (it's like I can hear him now)<br>
        I can hear him now<br>
        Um, Bruno...<br>
        Yeah, about that Bruno...<br>
        I really need to know about Bruno...<br>
        Gimmie the truth and the whole truth, Bruno<br>
        (Isabella, your boyfriend's here)<br>
        Time for dinner!<br>
        A seven-foot frame (it was my wedding day, it was our wedding day)<br>
        Rats along his back (we were getting ready)<br>
        When he calls your name (and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)<br>
        It all fades to black (no clouds allowed in the sky!)<br>
        Yeah, he sees your dreams (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-)<br>                 
        And feasts on your screams (thunder!)<br>
        You telling this story, or am I?<br>
        I'm sorry, mi vida, go on (óye, Mariano's on his way)<br>
        Bruno says, "It looks like rain" (a seven-foot frame, rats along his back)<br>
        In doing so, he floods my brain<br>
        Married in a hurricane<br>
        He's here!<br>
        Don't talk about Bruno, no! (Why did I talk about Bruno?)<br>
        Not a word about Bruno!<br>
        I never should've brought up Bruno!</p><br>
